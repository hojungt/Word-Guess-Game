##### * Begin the game by entering any KEY.
##### * The numbers of underscored spaces are assigned by the number of alphabets of the answer.
##### * For every letter guessed right, it will pop up in Right Guesses and replace the underscored spaces with the guess.
##### * For every letter guessed wrong, it will pop up in Wrong Guesses and deduct chances remaining.
##### * If you have no chances remaining, you are out!

## What Is the Goal of This Project?
#### Creating a game app that runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## How Does It Work?
#### The javascript code uses an array for storing multiple string values as possible answers. It generates an answer randomly for referencing logical operators, which comprise the guessed-right, guessed-wrong, winning, and losing conditions. All condition outputs are displayed in HTML. 

## Who Can Use this Repo?
#### Anyone! :tada:
